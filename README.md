# Simple Web Projects

This repository is where I put some of the simpler projects from [The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by Angela Yu.

I may have used bits of my previous knowledge in some of the projects here, or I may have just had fun with them!

I am writing this *beforehand* so I don't know what I would end up doing to be honest.
